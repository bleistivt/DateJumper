Important Notes: 


1)  If your forum is embedded - this plugin may not work.  No, I cannote fix it for you.

2)  If you modified any of these settings in your translations this plugin may not work as expected.  It is crucial that time is only displayed on current day.  If the time is displayed on other days, this plugin will not work with current logic.

$Definition['Date.DefaultTimeFormat'] = '%l:%M%p'; // If in current day
$Definition['Date.DefaultDayFormat'] = '%B %e'; // If in same year
$Definition['Date.DefaultYearFormat'] = '%B %Y'; // If not in same year
$Definition['Date.DefaultFormat'] = '%B %e, %Y'; // general applications
$Definition['Date.DefaultDateTimeFormat'] = '%c'; // date/time used in attributes

No, I can only support these settings.

3)   How do I Change Css colors?   in the css file in the plugin.
